    <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>Mochi is a bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice flour or mochigome.</p>
      <p>It has a soft, chewy texture that is somewhat elastic.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>1 cup of sweetened red bean paste.</li>
          <li>1 cup of glutinous rice flour.</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon of green tea powder (matcha).</li>
          <li>1 cup of water.</li>
          <li>¼ cup of white sugar.</li>
          <li>½ cup of cornstarch, for rolling out the dough.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Wrap the red bean paste in aluminum foil and place it in the freezer for at least an hour, until it becomes solid.</li>
          <li>Mix the glutinous rice flour and the green tea powder in a microwave-safe bowl. Then, stir in water and sugar and mix it until it becomes smooth.</li>
          <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 min. and 30 seconds.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, take the red bean paste out of the freezer and divide it into 8 equal balls.</li>
          <li>Remove the rice flour mixture from the microwave and stir the mixture. Then microwave it again for 15 to 30 seconds.</li>
          <li>Dust a plain surface with cornstarch. Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot rice flour mixture into a ball. Flatten the ball and place one ball of frozen red bean paste in the center. Pinch and press the dough around the bean paste until it's completely covered. Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi, seam-side down, in a paper muffin liner to prevent it from sticking.</li>
          <li>Repeat step 6 to make the remaining mochi and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
