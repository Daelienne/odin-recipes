    <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Easy, yeasted cinnamon rolls.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages of active dry yeast.</li>
            <li>¼ cup of warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C).</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups of buttermilk.</li>
            <li>½ cup of vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of baking soda.</li>
            <li>½ cup of butter, melted.</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups of brown sugar.</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons of ground cinnamon.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. In a small saucepan, heat the buttermilk until it's warm to the touch.</li>
            <li>Pour the buttermilk and oil into the yeast mixture; mix well. Combine the flour, salt and baking soda. Stir the flour mixture into the liquid 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 20 times. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes. In a small bowl, stir together the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out into a large rectangle. Spread the brown sugar and butter mixture over the dough, roll up into a log and pinch the seam to seal. Slice into 1 inch pieces and place cut side up in a lightly greased 10x15 baking pan. Cover and let rise 30 minutes or cover and refrigerate overnight. If baking immediately, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes before serving and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
